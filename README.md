# Cognitive Behavioral Traits Prediction using MLP

This project uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model to predict cognitive and behavioral traits based on structured input features. The system demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using machine learning techniques.
